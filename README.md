## Overview

The simulation framework models gamma-ray interactions specifically for low-energy photons characteristic of the Na-22 spectrum. This radioactive isotope decays via beta-plus (β⁺) decay, producing a positron that subsequently annihilates with an electron, emitting two 511 keV gamma photons in opposite directions. Additionally, Na-22 emits a 1274 keV gamma photon following its decay to an excited state of neon-22.

Given the energy range of interest, the simulation focuses on two dominant interaction processes: **Compton scattering** and **photoelectric effect**, omitting pair production due to its higher energy threshold. The framework provides an environment for simulating real-world particle interactions, supporting key experimental configurations:

- **Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy**: Analyze energy spectra from Na-22, identifying characteristic peaks at 511 keV and 1274 keV.
- **Coincidence Detection**: Simulate the simultaneous detection of 511 keV photons resulting from positron annihilation, crucial for studies in positron emission tomography (PET) and correlated photon measurements.
- **Compton Scattering**: Investigate photon scattering on various target materials to study the angular distribution and energy shift as predicted by Compton’s formula.

In addition, the framework integrates 3D visualization tools. These tools allow users to explore photon trajectories, detector arrangements, and scattering targets, enhancing comprehension of photon-matter interactions and supporting intuitive and detailed analysis of gamma-ray behavior and scattering dynamics.

## Photon Interaction Types

### 1. Photoelectric Effect
A photon is completely absorbed by an atom, ejecting an electron with energy equal to the photon's energy minus the binding energy of the electron.

#### Cross-section calculation
The cross-section for the photoelectric effect is computed using a formula involving the atomic number of the detector material and the photon's energy. (form "A Modern Primer to Particle and Nuclear Physycs" by F.Terranova page 69).

The Photoelectric cross-section is computed using:

For $\epsilon << 1$ (low-energy photons):

$$
\sigma_{\text{photoelectric}} = c \cdot Z^5 \cdot \epsilon^{-3.5} \hspace{1.5cm} c = 0.665 \cdot \sqrt{32} \cdot \alpha^4 \cdot b
$$

For $\epsilon >> 1$ (high-energy photons):

$$
\sigma_{\text{photoelectric}} = c \cdot Z^5 \cdot \epsilon^{-1} \hspace{1.5cm} c =  0.665 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot \alpha^4 \cdot b
$$

Where: 
- $\epsilon = \frac{E_{\gamma}}{m_{e}}$
  - $E_{\gamma}$ is the **photon energy**.
  - $m_{e}$ is the **electron rest mass energy**.
- $Z$ is the **atomic number** of the detector.
- $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{137}$ is the **fine-structure constant**.
- $b=10^{-28}$ m $^2$ is the symbol for the **barn** unit.
 
### 2. Compton Scattering
A photon collides with an electron, transferring part of its energy to the electron, which is ejected from the atom. The photon scatters with reduced energy and changes direction.

#### Cross-section calculation
The cross-section for Compton scattering is computed based on the Thomson scattering cross-section and other parameters like the photon energy and the scattering angle.
(form "A Modern Primer to Particle and Nuclear Physycs" by F.Terranova page 71).

The Compton cross-section is computed using:

$$
\sigma_{\text{Compton}} = c \cdot Z \left( \frac{(1 + \epsilon)}{\epsilon^2} \left( \frac{2(1 + \epsilon)}{1 + 2\epsilon} - \frac{\ln(1 + 2\epsilon)}{\epsilon} \right) + \frac{\ln(1 + 2\epsilon)}{2\epsilon} - \frac{1 + 3\epsilon}{(1 + 2\epsilon)^2} \right)
$$

Where:
- $\epsilon = \frac{E_{\gamma}}{m_e}$
  - $E_{\gamma}$ is the **photon energy**.
  - $m_{e}$ is the **electron rest mass energy**.
- $Z$ is the **atomic number** of the detector.
- $c$ is a constant: $c = \frac{3}{4} \sigma_{\text{Thompson}}$.

The **Thomson scattering cross-section** is given by:

$$
\sigma_{\text{Thompson}} = \frac{8}{3} \pi r_e^2
$$

Where $r_e = 2.817 \cdot 10^{-15}$ m is the **classical electron radius**.
