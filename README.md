## Overview

The simulation framework models gamma-ray interactions specifically for low-energy photons characteristic of the Na-22 spectrum. This radioactive isotope decays via beta-plus (β⁺) decay, producing a positron that subsequently annihilates with an electron, emitting two 511 keV gamma photons in opposite directions. Additionally, Na-22 emits a 1274 keV gamma photon following its decay to an excited state of neon-22.

Given the energy range of interest, the simulation focuses on two dominant interaction processes: **Compton scattering** and **photoelectric effect**, omitting **pair production** due to its higher energy threshold. 

The framework provides an environment for simulating real-world particle interactions, supporting key experimental configurations:

- **Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy**: Analyze energy spectra from Na-22, identifying characteristic peaks at 511 keV and 1274 keV.
- **Coincidence Detection**: Simulate the simultaneous detection of 511 keV photons resulting from positron annihilation, crucial for studies in positron emission tomography (PET) and correlated photon measurements.

In addition, the framework integrates 3D visualization tools. These tools allow users to explore photon trajectories, detector arrangements, and scattering targets, enhancing comprehension of photon-matter interactions and supporting intuitive and detailed analysis of gamma-ray behavior and scattering dynamics.

## Photon Interaction Types

In this simulation, the interactions considered are **Compton scattering** and **photoelectric absorption**, as they are the most significant processes for 511 keV photons. **Pair production** is excluded because it occurs only at photon energies above 1.022 MeV, which is beyond the energy range of interest. 

### Thomson scattering cross-section

The **Thomson scattering cross-section** is given by:

$$
\sigma_{\text{Thompson}} = \frac{8}{3} \pi r_e^2
$$

Where $r_e = 2.817 \cdot 10^{-15}$ m is the **classical electron radius**.


### 1. Photoelectric Effect
A photon is completely absorbed by an atom, ejecting an electron with energy equal to the photon's energy minus the binding energy of the electron.

<div align="center">
  <img src="utilities/photoelectric_effect.png" alt="Photoelectric effect" width="250">
</div>

#### Cross-section calculation
The cross-section for the photoelectric effect is computed using a formula involving the atomic number of the detector material and the photon's energy (form https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray_cross_section).

The **Photoelectric cross-section** is computed using:

$$
\sigma_{\text{photoelectric}} = c \left( \frac{Z m_e}{E_{\gamma}} \right)^5 \left( \gamma^2 - 1 \right)^{3/2} \left[ \frac{4}{3} + \frac{\gamma (\gamma - 2)}{\gamma + 1} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2 \gamma \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1}} \ln \left( \frac{\gamma + \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1}}{\gamma - \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1}} \right) \right) \right]
$$

where:
- $c = \frac{3}{2} \alpha^4 \sigma_{\text{Thomson}}$.
- $\gamma = \frac{E_{\gamma} + m_e - E_b}{m_e}$.
- $E_{\gamma}$ is the **photon energy**.
- $m_e$ = 511 keV is the **electron rest mass energy**.
- $E_b \approx 0$ is the **bond energy** for the electron.
- $Z$ is the **atomic number**.
- $\alpha\approx \frac{1}{137}$ is the **fine-structure constant**.
 
### 2. Compton Scattering
A photon collides with an electron, transferring part of its energy to the electron, which is ejected from the atom. The photon scatters with reduced energy and changes direction.

<div align="center">

</div>


#### Cross-section calculation
The cross-section for Compton scattering is computed based on the Thomson scattering cross-section and other parameters like the photon energy and the scattering angle (form https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray_cross_section).

The **Compton cross-section** is computed using:

$$
\sigma_{\text{Compton}} = c Z \left[ \frac{(1 + \epsilon)}{\epsilon^2} \left( \frac{2(1 + \epsilon)}{1 + 2\epsilon} - \frac{\ln(1 + 2\epsilon)}{\epsilon} \right) + \frac{\ln(1 + 2\epsilon)}{2\epsilon} - \frac{1 + 3\epsilon}{(1 + 2\epsilon)^2} \right]
$$

where:
- $c = \frac{3}{4} \sigma_{\text{Thomson}}$.
- $\epsilon = \frac{E_{\gamma}}{m_e}$.
- $E_{\gamma}$ is the **photon energy**.
- $m_e$ = 511 keV is the **electron rest mass energy**.

### Interaction Probability and Attenuation  

The probability of interaction for a photon traveling through a material depends on the **total cross-section** and material properties such as density and molar mass. This is calculated in two steps:  

#### Attenuation Factor  

The **attenuation factor** is defined as the inverse of the photon's mean free path in the material:  

$$
\mu = \frac{\rho \cdot N_a}{\text{MM}} \cdot \sigma_{tot}
$$

where:  
- $N_a = 6.022\cdot 10^{23}$ 1/mol is the **Avogadro's number**.  
- $\rho$ is the **density** (in g/cm^3) of the scattering material.
- $\text{MM}$ is the **molar mass** (in g/mol) of the scattering material.
- $\sigma_{tot}$ is the **total cross section**, calculated combining the contributions of the photoelectric and Compton cross-sections.

#### Interaction Probability  

Using the attenuation factor, the probability of photon interaction after traveling a distance $d$ in the material is:  

$$
\wp = 1 - e^{-\mu d}
$$
